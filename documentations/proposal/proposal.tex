%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is

%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier.

%% These few lines make a distinction between latex and pdflatex calls and they
%% bring in essential packages for graphics and font handling.
%% Note that due to the \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{} call it is no longer necessary
%% to provide the the path and extension of a graphics file:
%% \includegraphics{diamondrule} is completely sufficient.
